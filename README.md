## Techniques

### One pass
Use multiple arrays (or some type of collections) that are constructed from one or more loops, to avoid nesting loops. 

### Two pointers
Use two pointers to iterate through the same array (usually one starting at the beginning and the other starting at the end of the array). This allows you to traverse the array in one pass while comparing multiple values at the same and without needing nested loops.
